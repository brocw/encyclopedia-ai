Write a concise, well-structured encyclopedia article on the topic: '%s'.

Requirements:
- Factual, neutral tone. Easy to understand.
- Use Markdown format with ## for section headers (never # or ###).
- Do NOT start with the topic name as a heading — begin the article body immediately.
- Do NOT write a concluding paragraph or "Conclusion" section.
- Do NOT include a "References" or "See Also" section — these are generated separately.
- Do NOT use monospace/code blocks for any content.
- Keep paragraphs concise. Use prose, not bullet lists, for the main body.
